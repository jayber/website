            <h2>Learn the art of good listening</h2>
            <p>People are bad at listening. We experience this personally when we talk to others who don't seem
                to hear anything we say, and we see it in society in general.</p>
            <p>I want to give people the opportunity to learn better listening
                skills: to help each other, and to make the world a more sensitive
                place.</p>
